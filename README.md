# Atreides Helper

A PyQt6 based GUI for keeping track of information gathered whilst playing as House Atreides in the Dune board game

## "Installation" and usage

1. Clone the repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python main.py`
4. Select which factions you are playing against
5. Use the "Select card" menu buttons to display cards as and when they're known
  - The text box on the right of each row can be used for other notes etc.

## Known issues

- Resizing is a pain, so app is (or should be...) restricted to maximised only

## Future plans

- Some way of "zooming in" on a card so that fine print is actually readable
